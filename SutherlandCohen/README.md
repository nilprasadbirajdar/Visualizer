# Sutherland-Cohen Line Clipping Implementation
## Overview
This C++ code provides an implementation of line clipping using the Sutherland-Cohen algorithm. The Sutherland-Cohen algorithm is a line-clipping algorithm that classifies a line segment based on the region codes of its endpoints. This implementation includes the computation of binary codes and the line clipping process.

## Files
SutherlandCohen.h: Header file containing the declaration of the SutherlandCohen class.
SutherlandCohen.cpp: Source file containing the implementation of the SutherlandCohen class methods.
pch.h: Precompiled header file.
Other dependencies: Ensure that you have necessary dependencies installed or included in your project.
## Usage
To use the Sutherland-Cohen line clipping implementation, follow these steps:

Include the necessary headers in your project:

cpp
Copy code
#include "pch.h"
#include "SutherlandCohen.h"
Create an instance of the SutherlandCohen class by providing Line objects representing the line segment and the diagonal line.

cpp
Copy code
Line myLine(/* specify start and end points */);
Line diagonalLine(/* specify diagonal line points */);

SutherlandCohen sutherlandCohen(myLine, diagonalLine, mVertices, mColors);
Integrate the generated vertices and colors into your rendering pipeline as needed.

cpp
Copy code
// Use the generated vertices and colors for rendering
Line Clipping Process
The Sutherland-Cohen line clipping process involves computing binary codes for the endpoints of a line segment and iteratively clipping the line until it is completely inside the specified region. The resulting clipped line is then stored in the mVertices and mColors vectors.

Notes
Ensure that the necessary dependencies are properly configured and included in your project.
The code includes a basic implementation; additional features and optimizations can be added as needed.
